## What do I want to do with my Substack?
### Write book reviews. Why? Who would pay for that?
### Write political commentary. On what aspect of political life? what would distinguish me?
### Write about science fiction? Okay but what would the angle be?
### advice to graduate students and writers on how to write and navigate professional life. Would this be exploitative?
### gossip and news on literary studies. would this require me to reach out to people?
### I could think of the [[Substack]]
